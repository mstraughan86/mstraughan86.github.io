# Jekyll Now Plus

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)).

**Jekyll Now** makes it easier to create your Jekyll blog, by eliminating a lot of the up front setup.

- You don't need to touch the command line.
- You don't need to install/configure ruby, rvm/rbenv, ruby gems :relaxed:.
- You don't need to install runtime dependencies like markdown processors, Pygments, etc.
- If you're on Windows, this will make setting up Jekyll a lot easier.
- It's easy to try out, you can just delete your forked repository if you don't like it.

**Jekyll Now Plus** adds development environment instructions and allows for continuous modular customization.

- Development environment has already been setup! Check out your invitaion link for Cloud9 IDE access.
- Docker development container has been created for you! Check out the instructions below.
- Customizations to be added. See Roadmap below.

## Quick Start

### Step 1) Fork Jekyll Now Plus to your User Repository

Fork this repo, then rename the repository to yourgithubusername.github.io.

### Step 2) Customize and view your site

Enter your site name, description, avatar and many other options by editing the _config.yml file. You can easily turn on Google Analytics tracking, Disqus commenting and social icons here too.

Making a change to _config.yml (or any file in your repository) will force GitHub Pages to rebuild your site with jekyll. Your rebuilt site will be viewable at <https://yourgithubusername.github.io>.

> There are 3 different ways that you can make changes to your blog's files:

> 1. Edit files within your new username.github.io repository in the browser at GitHub.com (shown below).
> 2. Use a third party GitHub content editor, like [Prose by Development Seed](http://prose.io). It's optimized for use with Jekyll making markdown editing, writing drafts, and uploading images really easy.
> 3. Clone down your repository and make updates locally, then push them to your GitHub repository.

### Step 3) Publish your first blog post

Edit `/_posts/2014-3-3-Hello-World.md` to publish your first blog post. This [Markdown Cheatsheet](http://www.jekyllnow.com/Markdown-Style-Guide/) might come in handy.

> You can add additional posts in the browser on GitHub.com too! Just hit the + icon in `/_posts/` to create new content. Just make sure to include the [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) block at the top of each new blog post and make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md

## Development

#### Jekyll Now Plus

If you recieved the Cloud9 IDE invitation, here are the steps to follow when creating your new workspace:
1. Workspace name can be whatever you want. Mine is ```My-Jekyll```.
2. Description should be ```your-github-username/My-Jekyll```. Mine looks like ```mstraughan86/My-Jekyll```.
3. Paste in your git clone ssh address ```git@github.com:mstraughan86/Jekyll-Now-Plus.git```.
4. Choose ```Ruby``` for your template.
5. Load up your workspace. In your terminal, execute the following commands:
```
gem install github-pages
jekyll serve --host $IP --port $PORT --baseurl ''
```
6. You are setup to view your "local" environment by clicking on ```Preview > Preview RUnning Application```. It will open up a URL, something like ```https://my-jekyll-username.c9users.io```.
7. Remember to close your server by pressing ```CTRL + C``` in the terminal.

#### Local Development

1. Install Jekyll and plug-ins in one fell swoop. `gem install github-pages` This mirrors the plug-ins used by GitHub Pages on your local machine including Jekyll, Sass, etc.
2. Clone down your fork `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourusername.github.io.git`
3. Serve the site and watch for markup/sass changes `jekyll serve`
4. View your website at http://127.0.0.1:4000/
5. Commit any changes and push everything to the master branch of your GitHub user repository. GitHub Pages will then rebuild and serve your website.

#### Personal Development (Notes to Self)
Github does not easily allow you to branch your own repository, so in order for me to ease development from production, I have manually cloned the reponsitory and set the upstream that points to ```https://github.com/mstraughan86/Jekyll-Now-Plus/```. This is not a true fork, beware of this caveat future-self. In order to pull down changes, do the following commands:
```
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/master
git push
```

## Roadmap
- [ ] New base templates for different kinds of posts.
- [ ] Create dockerfile for containerized development.

## Contributing

Issues and Pull Requests are greatly appreciated. If you've never contributed to an open source project before I'm more than happy to walk you through how to create a pull request.

You can start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now/issues/new) describing the problem that you're looking to resolve and we'll go from there.

I want to keep Jekyll Now as minimal as possible. Every line of code should be one that's useful to 90% of the people using it. Please bear that in mind when submitting feature requests. If it's not something that most people will use, it probably won't get merged. :guardsman:
